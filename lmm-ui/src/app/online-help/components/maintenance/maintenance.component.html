          Use this procedure to post a line by its directory number (DN) so you
          can perform maintenance on the line.
        </p>
        <h4>Restrictions</h4>
        <p>
          V5.2 line maintenance is not supported using the Line Maintenance
          Manager (LMM). V5.2 line maintenance is performed using the C20 MAPCI
          interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the C20 supports both legacy DMS TDM lines as well as Succession
          lines, TDM lines can be posted on LMM and maintenance operations like
          BSY/RTS/FRLS/INB can be performed; however, the CS Line State column
          will not be displayed accurately. The Endpoint State column will show
          "Legacy Line" and the GW Profile column and all properties not
          applicable to TDM lines will display as "Not Available".
        </p>
        <p>
          When using hunt groups, you can only post the primary DN using the
          Line Maintenance Manager. You cannot perform line maintenance
          operations on all members of a hunt group using the LMM. If you need
          to perform line maintenance on all members of a hunt group, use the
          C20 MAPCI interface. For details, refer to the DMS-100 Family National
          ISDN BRI Service Implementation Guide, 297-2401-201.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Line Maintenance Manager (LMM) status fields must be Green (OK) in
          order to post lines.

          When post-by-gateway is selected on the LMM GUI, the line state at the
          CM is displayed. A on-demand audit to identify the state of the
          endpoint on the gateway is also done through the GWC and the endpoint
          state is displayed at the LMM GUI Endpoint State field. This audit is
          done in a protocol independent manner by the LMM. Any errors produced
          during the posting activity will be displayed on the status panel
          shown below
