    <h2>Functional Description</h2>
    <div class="p-mb-4">
        <p class="p-mb-2">The Controller panel provides data specific to the selected Gateway Controller. The
            configuration data
            displayed may not be changed, with the exception of the profile. A description of the fields are provided
            below.

    <h3>Retrieval Criteria</h3>
    <div class="p-mb-4">
        <p>Enter search criteria in this field. The last twenty search strings are stored during the session. Previous
            search strings may be re-called by selecting from the drop-down list.
        </p>
        <ul class="flex-row">
            <div class="p-grid p-fluid p-col-6">
                <li>One or more strings may be entered in the Retrieval Criteria,
                    separated by space(s).
                    Each string in the criteria is compared with the value in each column. If match is found
                    in any column, the record will be returned.</li>
                <li>Each string in the criteria is automatically wild carded at the beginning and ending of
                    the string (e.g. a string of "gate" will match "MYGATEWAY", "GATEWAY1", etc...).</li>
                <li>Two special characters are supported as modifiers.The plus "+" and minus "-" signs.
                    <br>The "+" plus character prefixed to the string (e.g. "+gate") means the value must match.
                    <br>The "-" character prefixed to the string (e.g. "-gate") means the value must not match.
                    <br>The "+" character is assumed, so is not typically used.
                </li>
                <li>The search is not case specific. A string of "gate" will return records where the following
                    strings are found: "MYGATEWAY", "MyGateway", or "mygateway".</li>
            </div>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Limit Results</h3>
    <div class="p-mb-4">
        <p>Specifies the number which limits the number of matching entries returned. You may select a value from the
            list or enter a value directly in the field. The values in the list include: 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 and
            No Limit. (Note: No limit is still limited by the maximum number of entries supported, which is 4096.)
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Replace List</h3>
    <div class="p-mb-4">
        <p>Specifies the results returned should replace the existing data in the table. If no records matching the
            search criteria are found, the contents of the table are cleared. This is the default selection.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Append to List</h3>
    <div class="p-mb-4">
        <p>Specifies the results returned should be appended to the existing data in the table. You may create a list of
            unlike items by performing simple multiple searches, with this option selected.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Retrieve</h3>
    <div class="p-mb-4">
        <p>Retrieves data from the server matching the “Retrieval criteria”. The number of entries returned will not
            exceed the value specified by “Limit results”. The data is a “snapshot” based on the currently provisioned
            data. Newly added or deleted data will not be dynamically reflected in the list.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Retrieve All</h3>
    <div class="p-mb-4">
        <p>Retrieves all the data, up to the maximum of 4096 entries. Values in the “Retrieval criteria” and “Limit
            results” are ignored. (Note: “Replace List” is automatically selected.)
        </p>

    <h3>List table</h3>
    <div class="p-mb-4">
        <p>This table displays the data matching the search criteria. Clicking a column header will sort the rows, in
            ascending order, based on the values in that column. Clicking a header a second time will sort the rows in
            descending order.

    <h3>Number of results</h3>
    <div class="p-mb-4">

    <h2>Search Examples</h2>
    <div class="p-mb-4">
        <p>The following examples are using the Gateway panel:</p>
        <p>Retrieval Criteria: "gate" <br>Expected Results: Returns all records where the string, or sub string is
            found, in any column. <br>A match for the example string should only be found in the Gateway name column.
        </p>
        <p>
            Retrieval Criteria: "aspen"<br>Expected Results: Returns all records where the string, or sub string is
            found, in any column. <br>A match for the example string could be found in the Protocol column.
        </p>
        <p>
            Retrieval Criteria: "47.108.2 -aspen" <br>Expected Results: Returns all records where the string, or sub
            string, "47.108.2" is found in <br>any column (which should be the IP Address column) and the string "aspen"
            is not found <br>(which should be the protocol field). Basically, the records returned should include all
            Gateways <br>where the subnet equals "47.108.2" and the protocol is not Aspen.
        </p>
        <p>Keep in mind, a search string of "1" for example will return all records where a "1" is found in ANY column.
            Since this value may be found in numerous columns (Gateway, IP Address and Logical Group columns for Gateway
            searches) it is likely to match a lot of records, so a more detailed string is suggested.</p>
